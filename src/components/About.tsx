          Hello there! I'm a full-stack web developer with a passion for cloud
          computing. Currently, I'm studying computer science and engineering at
          SRM University in Andhra Pradesh.
          <div className="py-3"></div>
          On the professional side, I love nothing more than delving into the
          intricate workings of a website and creating seamless user
          experiences. I'm skilled in various programming languages and have
          experience with a range of tools and platforms.
          <div className="py-3"></div>
          When I'm not coding, you can find me watching movies or listening
          songs, trying new Tech. I'm always on the lookout for new challenges
          and opportunities to grow, both personally and professionally.{" "}
          <div className="py-3"></div>
          So if you're looking for a talented full-stack web developer who knows
          how to bring the funny, look no further. I'm your gal!
